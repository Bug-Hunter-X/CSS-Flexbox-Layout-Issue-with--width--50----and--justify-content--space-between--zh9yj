The issue can be solved by using `flex-shrink: 1;` on the `.item` elements to allow them to shrink if necessary to fit within the container:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
}

.item {
  width: 50%;
  flex-shrink: 1; /* Solution */
}
```

Alternatively, you could use `flex-basis` for more precise width control, or remove the `width` property and let the flex items distribute space naturally with `justify-content: space-between`.
