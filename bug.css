The following CSS code causes an unexpected layout issue in some browsers:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
}

.item {
  width: 50%; /* Issue occurs here */
}
```

The issue is that if the total width of `.item` elements exceeds the width of the `.container`, the `space-between` property doesn't work as expected and the elements might overlap or not be spaced correctly.
